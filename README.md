> Now, Paimon is on your Windows "system tray"!

PaimonTray is a Windows desktop app that can present Genshin Impact's real-time notes for users. Thanks to real-time notes, it becomes more convenient for the game players to be able to track a list of things as follows.

- Daily commissions: completed with bonus rewards claimed?
- Enemies of Note: any remaining Original Resin cost-halving opportunity this week?
- Expeditions: show me the game characters dispatched!
- Original Resin: fully replenished?
- Parametric Transformer: can be used?
- Realm Currency: limit reached?

Paimon now makes real-time notes available on your Windows taskbar corner (aka the notification area or "system tray"). It can be absolutely a pain in the arse without this tool app. What do you reckon? ü§™

PaimonTray also has some other highlights that may interest you. These include but not limited to:

- Web page login method: log into your account on the specific web page just like in a browser<sup id="source1">[1](#footnote1)</sup> to add/update an account.
- Alternative login method: logging into your account by entering cookies manually is another way to add/update an account.
- Not only the CN server (aka a miHoYo account) but also the global (aka a HoYoLAB account).
- Multiple accounts<sup id="source2">[2](#footnote2)</sup> with nifty management: all your added accounts can be updated, checked and refreshed, or removed.
- Only your selected characters: all characters (aka Genshin Impact accounts) linked with a miHoYo/HoYoLAB account are there for you to select whether to allow retrieving real-time notes.
- Configurable real-time notes refresh interval.
- _Real-time notes reminders (will be available in the future)._
- Date and time rather than duration: e.g., Paimon converts the duration required to complete/fully replenish/... to an estimated date and time to make it clear.
- Hints for "not yet unlocked" if Paimon can tell you.
- Dark mode support.
- Acrylic/Mica support<sup id="source3">[3](#footnote3)</sup>.
- I18n (Internationalisation). Supported languages as follows:
  - English (United Kingdom)
  - English (United States) - default if no matches
  - ‰∏≠ÊñáÔºàÁÆÄ‰ΩìÔºå‰∏≠ÂõΩÔºâ

## üí° Why not give it a try?

You can get PaimonTray from:

- **_(Recommended)_ Microsoft Store**

  > ‚ùå Will be available in the future. Pending some tweaks, completing Microsoft's app certification process, and final tests.

  Please always use this way if possible. It allows you to always be on the latest version when a new build with automatic updates is released, though it depends on [Microsoft's app certification process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/uwp/publish/the-app-certification-process).

- [Releases](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/PaimonTray/releases)

  > ‚ùå Should be available soon! Pending code signing and final tests.

  If the above recommended way is inconvenient for you, downloading the latest MSIX bundle file (`PaimonTray_<version>.msixbundle`) is another option. You can double-click the downloaded file to install the app via the app installer. In this way, the app will NOT auto-update when new builds are released, so you will need to regularly install the latest release. If it fails for any reason, you can try the following command at a PowerShell prompt.

  ```PowerShell
  # NOTE: If you are using PowerShell 7+, please run the following command before using Add-AppxPackage.
  # Import-Module Appx -UseWindowsPowerShell

  Add-AppxPackage PaimonTray_<version>.msixbundle
  ```

## ‚ùó ATTENTION

> May I have your attention pls? üî•

1. This project is licensed under [the GPL-3.0 Licence](./LICENCE). By 19 June 2022, everything looks good with Visual Studio 2022 (Version: 17.2.4) + .NET 6.0. PaimonTray is built with Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3, which ships with the Windows App SDK. You may find [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment) useful to load the project. Additionaly, I would like to thankfully acknowledge the following author/projects.

   - Inspired by [PaimonMenuBar](https://github.com/spencerwooo/PaimonMenuBar).
   - API uses credited to [genshin.py](https://github.com/thesadru/genshin.py) and [DGP Studio](https://github.com/DGP-Studio).
   - App icon credited to [Chawong](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/92415888).
   - README banner background credited to [void_0](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/85543107).

2. Due to [the use of the Windows App SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/system-requirements#windows-app-sdk), PaimonTray is expected to work well on Windows 10, version 1809 (build 17763) and later (arm64, x64, and x86). **It is awfully safe to permit the app behaviour for any system prompt regarding safety confirmation. The app is signed, is not malware, and will never ever collect and upload any user privacy.** Should you report a problem encountered, you may find [issues](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/PaimonTray/issues) useful.
3. The NuGet packages of the project are listed in the following table.

   | Name                                |   Version    |
   | :---------------------------------- | :----------: |
   | H.NotifyIcon.WinUI                  |    2.0.50    |
   | Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.Notifications |    7.1.2     |
   | Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools    | 10.0.22621.1 |
   | Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK             |    1.1.1     |
   | Serilog.Sinks.Async                 |    1.5.0     |
   | Serilog.Sinks.File                  |    5.0.0     |

4. As stated above, PaimonTray is inspired by PaimonMenuBar. We even use the same app icon. However, you are not expected to consider PaimonTray as "PaimonMenuBar for Windows", or vice versa. We have various design ideas and patterns for the target platforms, and independent development road maps.
5. PaimonTray is designed to be a lightweight tool app focusing on **Genshin Impact's real-time notes only**. Performance is the very 1st priority. Continuous optimisation will be provided ~~(hopefully)~~. Currently, there is no plan to make it a fully-fledged app. Anyway, you are welcome to shout out your ideas.

Good luck! üíñ
